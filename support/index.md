# Support

If you're looking for answers you can't find in the documentation or need advice on the best way to solve a problem, there are a number of places you can find help.

## Mailing list

The WireMock mailing list has existed for many years and is searchable so is a good place to start looking for information not in the documentation.

## Slack

You can get real-time chat support from the WireMock community and core team by signing up to the [UP9 Slack](https://up9.com/slack) and joining the [#06-oss-wiremock](https://up9.slack.com/archives/C02V3EGV3U3) channel.

## Priority support

If you need a guaranteed response SLA and priority access to our team please [schedule a quick call](https://calendly.com/d/cmw-d8b-hmq/nick-tom-at-mocklab) with us.
